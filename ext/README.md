This directory is for shared libraries, such as [Mapp](https://github.com/aaronbolyard/Discworld) and [BMASHINA](https://github.com/bkdoormaus/BMASHINA).

# Layout

The required shared libraries are:

- Mapp
- BMASHINA

To use BMASHINA, lmashina/lua/B must also be copied.

That's all, folks. Have a good day.
