# Quests
## Raven's Eye
Create a new eye for Ravenâ€™s first mate. Mostly sailing-based. Involves shooting a zombie out of a cannon at one point. Woah!

## Mysterious Machinations
Help Hex build a stable portal to Azathoth. Unlocks Antilogika. Part of the 'Mysteries of the Empty King' series.

This is required to begin the end game quest, The Return of the Empty King.

### Requirements
* Level 10 foraging
* Level 10 magic
* Level 10 wisdom
* Quest: Calm before the Storm

### Reward
* Level 5 Antilogika
* Long-wave two-way tele-pager
* Ability to craft primordial time runes and azathothian spacial runes (used in the 'Unmagic spellbook' unlocked later in the quest series)

### Outline

1. Start the quest by talking to Hex in her lab. She'll make a mention of her quest to find the Drakkenson, a mysterious race of hyper-smart, time-jumping draconic creatures.
2. She'll give you a "primordial time rune" and ask you to go to the Eldritch ruins to pull them out of the past. This requires level 10 magic & wisdom.
3. The Eldritch ruins will be pulled into existence if you dowse at the ruins. However, you won't be able to enter them.
4. Configure the Ancient Light Matrix. It's a sliding puzzle... WITH ROTATION. OH-EM-GEE.
5. The matrix activates and the ruins open a portal... with static. You're unable to enter the portal.
6. Return to Hex. She'll say there's interference from the receiver, but she doesn't know where that is. She'll let Emily follow you to remotely diagnose the issue.
7. At the ruins with Emily, Emily will point out the antenna covered in 'strange mushrooms'. With level 10 foraging, you can pluck them.
8. Once the mushrooms are plucked, the static goes away. The portal to Azathoth opens.
9. You can enter the portal. Emily warns you not to. If you enter early, you take rapid damage from the weather.
10. Return to Hex. She's like "OMG" and if you entered the portal she calls you DUMB. She's like she's prepared for this moment FOREVER and gives you a hazmat suit. She gives you two items--"environment scrying mirror" and "long-wave two-way pager"--and asks you to explore.
11. Enter Azathoth with the hazmat suit. Run around. Eventually you'll find a similar 'Eldritch ruins'. Scan it.
12. Page Hex. She will be like super OMFG WTF THIS IS AMAZING. And ask you to bring back an 'azathothian spacial rune' in order to complete her experiment. She will tele-page you an unfocused rune. (If you don't have inventory space, RIP.)
13. When you go to leave, a Drakkenson will swoop down and land. It will be PISSED at you and tell you to STAY OUT OF THEIR WAY... or else. It will then fly off.
14. Return to Hex. Tell her about the Drakkenson and give her the azathothian spacial runes. Quest complete.

You can use the two-way pager at any time to talk to a Hex hologram. This has some easter eggs in some areas. For example, in the Light Puzzle at the High Chambers of Yendor.
