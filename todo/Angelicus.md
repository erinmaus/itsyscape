# Angelicus fight

- If flying, player can use "Gravity" Power (w/ Magic) or "Singularity" spell (w/ Magic, again) to force landing. Otherwise, Angelicus will deal more damage, cannot be attacked by Melee what-so-ever, and the player will have a greatly reduced attack distance when using Archery and Magic.

- If using a shield, player can use "Riposte" or "Parry" Powers (w/ Melee) to disarm shield. Otherwise, Angelicus will aggressively use defensive Powers and the player's damage dealt to Angelicus will be greatly reduced.

- If about to use Soul Split, player can use "Soul Strike" Power (w/ Archery) to make Angelicus lose focus. If the player fails to use "Soul Strike", then the player's soul will be split, causing a tremendous debuff directly to their stats. To restore stats, they will either have to use healing items or collect their soul fragment (which will be running around the arena, very quickly). The player can use the "Shockwave" Power (w/ Archery) to stun Angelicus, though, giving them time to collect their soul fragment. Or some other strategy like that, of course.

- When wielding her maul, Judgment, Angelicus can enter a Divine Wrath trance, where she pierces the player's divine protection and can deal massive damage. Use various defensive abilites to prevent this, such as "Iron Skin" or "Immortality". Less effectively, "Prepare" + "Absorb" or some other combo like that (assuming the player can survive the damage in the latter case). This cannot happen if Angelicus is wielding a shield. Magic would be the most effective style when facing Divine Wrath, and Archery the worst; there's plenty of other strategy using Magic debuffs and/or Melee powers/tankiness, as well.

- Angelicus can use powers just like the player. She will queue them, just like the player. However, Angelicus cannot reset the cooldown of her powers, like some creatures. Therefore, she will be stuck with the same cooldown as the player.

- Angelicus invokes Divine Protection via prayers (e.g., "Bastiel's Barricade"), much like the player. However, unlike the player, these offer 100% protection (with few exceptions). Still, like the player, Angelicus can only use one one of these prayers at a time. Furthermore, when she switches her protection prayers, she pauses for a brief moment, rather dramatically.

- Angelicus will switch her protection prayers periodically, based on how much damage she is dealt with that combat style. (Number unknown at time; requires balance.)

- Angelicus will switch up her combat style. She will either switch to a neutral or effective combat style (based on what the player is attacking with / defending against). This happens after X many attacks. Ideally, this X would not be random, but requires balancing. When Angelicus switches combat styles, she is very dramatic and pauses attacking for a moment.

- Angelicus's defences are not high unless 1. you are attacking her with the opposite combat style she is using (e.g., you are using Magic and she is using Archery), in which case that strategy is less effective; or 2. she has a shield. Generally, you want to be using the opposite attack style. Of course, her protection prayers can mess with that.

- Angelicus can use other prayers, as well, aligned with her combat style. The more prayer points she has, the more prayers she will use. If she runs of out of prayer points, she will pause and pray to Bastiel to restore her prayer points. Her defenses will go up, but she will not be attacking during this time nor using protection prayers (since she has no prayer points). This lasts X seconds (requires balancing).
