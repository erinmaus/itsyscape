# Goal: Tutorial Island
## Main
1) Character creation screen.
	a. Set aesthetics.
	b. Set gender, pronouns, etc. (Anything controversial behind "Advanced.")
	   - This is also where you'd set disability settings. (Also under
	     "Advanced.")
	c. Set graphics settings.
2) Spawn in Isabelle Island Tower, Recruitment Office.
	- "Start Quest: Calm Before the Storm"
3) Talk to Isabelle.
	- Can't leave room until you talk to her.
	- Summary:
		a. Bought island from Duke Frederich of Rumbridge.
		b. Island is haunted; some horror came to the island a hundred years
		   ago, had been abandoned since.
		c. Isabelle seeks to eliminate the horrors and reclaim the island for
		   the Vizier-King Yohn and the Kingdom of Mysthalon. (It's a lie.)
		d. Options are "Yes!", "Definitely!", "Absolutely!".
		e. Advises you to speak to her advisor in the lobby.
4) Talk to Advisor.
	- Tells you about the Island.
		a. Portmaster Jenkins needs help fishing, but there's a giant squid
		   that keeps attacking the ship.
		b. Needs crawling copper and tense tin for a reinforced bronze bar,
		   but it's protected by the Ghostly Miner Foreman.
		c. Need logs from the Ancient Driftwood, but it's protected by nymphs.
	- Gives you advice on where to start. (Portmaster Jenkins).
	- Says talk to him if you need any help.
	- If you talk to him again:
		a. Gives you a bronze pickaxe and wrought bronze key if you want to go
		   to the abandoned mine. (Can repeat so long as you don't have any.)
		b. Gives you a tinderbox and a bronze hatchet if you want to go to the
		   misty forest.
		c. Tells you to meet with Portmaster Jenkins if you want to do that.
5) So...
	a. Portmaster Jenkins
		- ???
	b. Abandoned Mine
		i. Make a reinforced bronze key.
		ii. Defeat the Ghostly Miner Foreman.
		iii. Obtain crawling copper and tense tin.
		- Optional:
			i. Kill all the Skelementals.
			ii. Make a full set of bronze armor.
			iii. Get level 10 mining and smithing.
		- By doing the optional content, Isabelle's Advisor gives you some XP
		  and gold.
	c. Misty Forest
		- ???
6) After completing all three tasks, you can go back to Isabelle.
	- If you "Listen" to Door, you can overhear Isabelle talking to ...
	  something. Basically, she mentions her real goal in vague terms: to
	  find the bloody chalice.
	- Isabelle congratulates you.
		- You can confront her if you listened to the door.
		- This just gives extra dialog / context.
	- Offers you a reward and bids you on your way. Says Jenkins will take you
	  to South Rumbridge Port.
7) Upon reaching Jenkins, there's an earthquake coming from abandoned mine.
   - Jenkins says it's too dangerous since there's a chance of a tsunami.
   - Tells you to rest for the night.
   - If you rest for the night, this happens again... and again... and again.
   - GOTTA INVESTIGATE!
8) Upon repeating the Abandoned Mine section (make key, defeat Ghostly Miner
   Foreman, go to room with crawling copper and tense tin), there's a ladder.
   Oooh!
9) Enter dungeon.
	- There's a sack of hay you can rest at.
10) Complete dungeon. Boss at end is Isabelle. She has the bloody chalice and
    uses archery with the occasional spell.
    - Has ~50 health. No tricks to deal lots of damage this time.
    - Uses the bloody chalice once when she is low on health.
    - There's some skeletons in the room. She resurrects them if you kill them.
      But the resurrection takes time; gives you a chance to DPS her.
11) Upon defeating her, she dies.
    - Wow!
    a. She drops an eerie iron key. This unlocks an unreachable room in the
       dungeon. If you jump down the hole you enter a room with the horrifying
       remains of Yendor, Slain Angel. He's dead though. There's runic pillars
       in the room.
    b. She also drops the bloody chalice (assuming you don't have it).
    c. The skeletons in the room die as well.
12) You can go back to Portmaster Jenkins and he says the ship was damaged and
    needs repaired. FIN.
    - Complete Quest: "Calm Before the Storm."
