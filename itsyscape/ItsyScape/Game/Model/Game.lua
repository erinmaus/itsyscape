-- The operations must be implemented for the various cases. For example:
--  * LocalGame: Runs completely on the client. No networking. Simulates
--    the game.
--  * ClientGame: Receives data from a server. Does not simulate the game.
--  * ServerGame: Sends data to a client. Simulates the game.
