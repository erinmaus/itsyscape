# ItsyScape, a WIP RPG-slash-Tycoon game

ItsyScape is a small tycoon game built on [Love2d](http://love2d.org). It's very
much a work in progress.

The general idea is you are a god-in-progress trying to obtain Elder artifacts,
like the Staff of Armadyllo, to ascend to godhood. Using a legion of peeps,
you have to defeat enemies, create stuff, and explore in order to find the
artifacts. Once you do, you can become a god, which has a few perks I guess.

Currently, none of that is implemented :). How lame.

Any similarities to [RuneScape](http://runescape.com) now or in the future are
only a coincidence ;).
