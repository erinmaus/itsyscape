# ItsyRealm, a tiny RPG game

ItsyRealm is a small RPG built on a slightly modified version of [Love2d](http://love2d.org). It's very much a work in progress.

The general idea is you're a would-be hero trying to save the world from mad gods who wish to conquer it. You start out as a weak nobody and can choose how to proceed based on your own desires. Throughout the game, you use combat and skills (like a game it's concindentally similar to) to advance and hopefully save the world.

Currently, none of that is implemented :). How lame! But there should be a dungeon you can explore soon enough...

Any similarities to [RuneScape](http://runescape.com) now or in the future are
only a coincidence ;).
