# ItsyRealm, a tiny RPG game

ItsyRealm is a small RPG built on a slightly modified version of [LÖVE](http://love2d.org), an \*awesome\* framework to make games in Lua. The game is very much a work in progress.

In ItsyRealm, you're on an awesome quest to discover the secrets of a necromancer god only known as the Empty King. Along your way, you'll employ dozens of unique strategies using staff, sword, and bow to fight mythical monsters and eldritch abominations. Utilize skills to gather resources while raiding dungeons, forests, ruins, seas, and more to craft powerful equipment and items. And help a bunch of like-minded adventurers achieve their own victories. Should you fail, the four Old Ones will succeed to tear the very fabric of reality apart...
